## Introduction

**This project** is an open-source Python tool designed to extract data from educational YouTube videos, particularly healthcare-related content, and rate them based on well-known healthcare scoring frameworks such as the DISCERN score, Global Quality Score (GQS), and JAMA benchmark criteria.

This project pulls video metadata like the channel name, views, likes, comments, and transcripts, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically rate healthcare videos based on their content quality.

This tool is designed for researchers, educators, and healthcare professionals looking to evaluate YouTube videos based on educational and informational quality.

## Features

- Extract metadata from YouTube videos (channel name, country, views, likes, comments, and subtitles availability).
- Scrape video transcripts (if available) for further analysis.
- Automatically rate healthcare content using:
  - **DISCERN Score**: Quality of health information.
  - **Global Quality Score (GQS)**: Overall quality.
  - **JAMA Benchmark Criteria**: Authorship, Attribution, Currency, and Disclosure.
- Export results to an Excel or CSV file for further analysis.
- Easy-to-use, customizable, and scalable for large datasets.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EduTubeRater.git
cd EduTubeRater

YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
YouTube Data API Key: You'll need to create a project in Google Cloud and enable the YouTube Data API.
OpenAI API Key: For LLM-based automatic video ratings.
Usage
Add Your API Keys:

After installing, create a .env file in the project root and add your API keys:

## Installation

After installing, create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:

```bash
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

## Usage
Add Your API Keys
After installing, create a .env file in the project root and add your API keys:

YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Prepare a List of YouTube Video Links
In the main script (main.py), replace the placeholder video_links list with your own set of video links:

Python

video_links = [
    'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example1',
    'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example2'
]
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Run the Script
To analyze the YouTube videos and generate an Excel file:

python main.py

Outputs
The tool will output an Excel file (youtube_videos.xlsx) that contains video details, including channel information, transcript, and quality scores (DISCERN, Global Quality, JAMA).

Each row corresponds to a video, with columns for all extracted data and computed scores.

## API Setup
To use EduTubeRater, you need API keys from the following services:

YouTube Data API
Create a project in the Google Cloud Console.
Enable the YouTube Data API v3.
Generate an API Key and add it to your .env file.
OpenAI API
Sign up for OpenAI API access.
Generate an API Key.
Add it to your .env file.

## Rating Criteria
The tool uses healthcare-specific quality benchmarks to evaluate YouTube content:

DISCERN Score: Rates the reliability and quality of health information (1-5).
Global Quality Score (GQS): A general score for the overall quality of the video (1-5).
JAMA Benchmark Criteria: Analyzes Authorship, Attribution, Currency, and Disclosure (scores from 0-4).
